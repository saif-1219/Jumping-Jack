# Jumping-Jack
A personal Game I made to learn pygame and somw Game Dev basics.

To play, unzip the rar file and open game.exe.

On the menu, use up and down arrow to navigate and press enter to select.

While playing, press space to jump and dodge the bullets and use left and right arrow keys to move. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible.
